# Enhancements

__Instructions__

Go to Boards (press b)
Read through the issues in the backlog

Is approved: move it to the Approved pipeline
Needs consideration by another department: tag them (e.g. @cwatt7), label & move it to the Under Review pipeline
Will be addressed in the future: add relevant notes and move it to the Postponed/Blocked pipeline
Is a pipe-dream: move it to the Someday pipeline

__About__

This is a new repo for any and all unapproved or postponed issues regarding enhancements, features, or ideas. Any issues that should be considered by design, copy, marketing, or management should be written here instead of in the ifit/ifit repo. Issues to be addressed in future updates or releases can be stored here and voted on.

__Who is this for?__

Everyone. Anyone can create issues here (no duplicates please) and everyone can browse through previously created issues, add notes, and +1 the ones you feel should be prioritized.
